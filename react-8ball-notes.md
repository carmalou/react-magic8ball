Thoughts so far

1. React has way less files than angular 5 :thumbs_up:

2. Create React App has a service worker set up BY DEFAULT. OMGGGGGGG

3. Label isn't a JSX tag?? Error: "Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag"

	- Looks like there must be a parent-level div wrapping everything. :shrug:

Note: Really dig the react error messages so far

Note: I did have to stop the timer about half way through to figure out what was going on with my new component
